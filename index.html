			<h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
			<div><b>Overview</b>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Steve Huffman is the cofounder of reddit.
					<br>The class went over how users, computers, servers, http and the internet all work together.
					<br>Went over general inline and block HTML tags to create HTML documents.
					<br>HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
					<br>HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language <b>HTML Attributes</b>
					<br>Attributes = provide additional information to the browser
					<br> anchor tags example<a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>
					<br>One last critical take away from the first class is the concept: computers are
					<span style="color:red">stupid</span>, they
					<em>only</em> do what you tell them to do. Programing is really all about writing the right instructions.</p>

			<h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
			<div><b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
				<div class="content">
					<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
					<b>The "treelike structure" of HTML</b>
					<p>The "tree-like structure" come from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...<br>In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes insid of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>
					<b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
					<p>When you reed an html document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. the more indented and element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p>
					<b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
					<p>When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. for example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</p>

			<h2>Lesson 3: Style and CSS</h2>
			<div><b>let's make the internet look great again (the easy way!)</b>
				<div class="content">
					<p>CSS (cascade style sheets) allows you to control how your website looks. By inputing style guidelines across the page by assigning style attributes to multiple objects. This greatly reduces formatting time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort">principle of greatest laziness</a> </p>
